# Stressed CalcBOT - Errbot

That's a simple calculator bot made with errbot lib that make math basic operations like sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.

CalcBOT: i'm very stressed, it means that if you ask me for a repeated result, independently the arguments you give me, i won't say it again.
